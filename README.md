## Innovators Patent Agreement - MSCDified

The [Innovators Patent Agreement](https://github.com/twitter/innovators-patent-agreement/blob/master/innovators-patent-agreement.md) (IPA) is a new way to do patent assignment that keeps control in the hands of engineers and designers, originally written by Twitter's legal team. 

I ([Luis Villa](http://lu.is/)) am forking the original IPA here as an experiment in the application of [A Manual of Style for Contract Drafting](http://www.adamsdrafting.com/writing/mscd/) to an existing, public legal document. I choose the IPA not because it is particularly badly drafted (it is almost certainly an above-average legal document), but because the fact that it is maintained in github and publicly circulated makes it a good target for this sort of thought experiment.

This experiment has two purposes:

1.  Educate me in more detail about the content of the MSCD.
2.  Help me write a book review of the MSCD.

Because of these goals, I may do some unusual things. Most notably (so far) I may make edits that don't seem like a good idea to me, but are recommended by MSCD; and my commit messages are written more in the style of a book review than an explanation of the actual commit. Others may be noted here as I come across them.
